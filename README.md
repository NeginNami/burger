# :hamburger: Burger :fries:

Burger is an application that implements the MVC architecture and takes advantage of handlebars for rendering the view. It also has its own ORM and does the express routing.

### Getting Started 

Go to the Burger application with this URL: (...) and add burger names to the database!

## Prerequisites & Installing

You don't need to install anything. Just a web browser is enough to explore the Burger.

 
### Running and test

Burger application stores burgers name in the database. Each burger has a status of Devoured. By default they are 0. If you hit the Devour button, it changes the status of that specific burger in the database to 1. The burgers which are devoured are shown up in a lighter color at the right side which sort of means they are not available.

## Deployment

Burger is a full stack application which is hosted on heroku.
